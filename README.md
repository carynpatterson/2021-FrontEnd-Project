# Sushi Go! Score Tracker

This project is a simple score tracking website for the card game Sushi Go!. The website allows you to choose the number of players (2-5), input their names, their scores for each round, and the final scores for puddings. The calculate button will total each player's final score. 


## CSS Features List: 

* The score cards are in a flexbox which is laid out in a column for mobile and changes to row on larger screens.

## JavaScript Features List: 

* The submitplayercount function uses a javascript loop to display or hide the correct number of player score cards based on the selection in the player count drop down box.

* Each calcPScore function uses let and const variables to calculate a player's score and displays their total on the page.
