# Sushi Go! Score Tracker

This project is a simple score tracking website for the card game Sushi Go!. The website allows you to choose the number of players (2-5), input their names, their scores for each round, and the final scores for puddings. The calculate button will total each player's final score and the reset scores button will reset all player's scores.


## CSS Features List: 

* The score cards are in a flexbox which is laid out in a column for mobile and changes to row on larger screens.

## JavaScript Features List: 

* The submitplayercount() function uses a javascript for loop to display or hide the correct number of player score cards based on the selection in the player count drop down box.

* Each calcPScore() function adds together the scores from a player's rounds/pudding and displays their total on the page.
